                Our Use of Cookies and Other Tracking Mechanisms<br>

                Cookies. Cookies are alphanumeric identifiers that we transfer to your computer’s hard drive through
                your web browser for record-keeping purposes. Some cookies allow us to make it easier for you to
                navigate our Platform, while others are used to enable a faster log-in process or to allow us to
                track your activities at our Platform. There are two types of cookies: session and persistent
                cookies.
                ·Session Cookies. Session cookies exist only during an online session. They disappear from your
                computer when you close your browser or turn off your computer. We use session cookies to allow our
                systems to uniquely identify you during a session or while you are logged into the Platform. This
                allows us to process your online transactions and requests and verify your identity, after you have

                ·Persistent Cookies. Persistent cookies remain on your computer after you have closed your browser
                or turned off your computer. We use persistent cookies to track aggregate and statistical
                information about user activity.
                Please note that our systems do not currently respond to do-not-track signals.

                Disabling Cookies. Most web browsers automatically accept cookies, but if you prefer, you can edit
                your browser options to block them in the future. The general settings on most browsers will tell
                you how to prevent your computer from accepting new cookies, how to have the browser notify you when
                you receive a new cookie, or how to disable cookies altogether. Users of our Platform who disable
                cookies will not be able to browse certain areas of the Platform.

                Personal Information with these third parties.

                Third-Party Links<br>
                Our Platform may contain links to third-party websites. Any access to and use of such linked
                websites is not governed by this Policy, but instead is governed by the privacy policies of those
                third-party websites. We are not responsible for the information practices of such third-party
                websites.<br>

                Security of Your Personal Information<br>
                We have implemented reasonable precautions consistent with applicable laws and regulations to
                protect the Personal Information we collect from loss, misuse, and unauthorized access, disclosure,
                alteration, and destruction. Please be aware that despite our efforts, no data security measures can
                guarantee 100% security. Therefore, all Users (including their Authorized Individuals) of the
                Platform must comply with the security requirements in the Terms and take the following additional
                steps to help ensure the security of their Personal Information and the access to their account:
                (a) You should choose a robust user identification, password, and PIN to access your account (“User
                Credentials”) that nobody else knows or could easily guess. User Credentials must meet the
                requirements we specify when you establish those User Credentials. You should keep your User
                Credentials secure and private, and not share your User Credentials with any third party.

                (b) You should install anti-virus, anti-spyware, and firewall software in your personal computers
                and mobile devices;

                (c) You should update operating systems, anti-virus, and firewall products with security patches or
                newer versions on a regular basis;

                (d) You should remove file and printer sharing in computers, especially when they are connected to
                the internet;

                (e) You should make regular backups of your critical data;

                (f) You should consider the use of encryption technology to protect highly sensitive or confidential
                information;

                (g) You should completely log off and clear your browser cache after finishing each online session
                with the Platform;

                (h) You should not install software or run programs of unknown origin;

                (i) You should delete junk or chain emails;

                (j) You should not open email attachments from strangers;

                (k) You should not disclose personal, financial, or credit card information to little-known or
                suspect websites;

                (l) You should not use a computer or a device that cannot be trusted; and

                (m) You should not use public or internet café computers to access online services or perform
                financial transactions.

                You should immediately notify us at support@bybit.com if you become aware of any unauthorized use or
                access of your Account or User Credentials. We are not responsible for any lost, stolen, or
                compromised User Credentials or for any activity on your Account via unauthorized activity using
                your User Credentials.


                Rights of access, correction, and deletion<br>
                You can access, edit, update, or delete your Account or Personal Information we have collected at
                any time by accessing your account settings or emailing us at helpdesk@annexwave.com. We will respond to
                your requests within a reasonable period of time, but no later than the time period required by law.

                Please note that notwithstanding the foregoing, there may be circumstances in which we are unable to
                accommodate a request to edit, update, access, or delete an account profile or Personal Information.
                This includes but is not limited to:

                ·any basis where such request can be denied under applicable law;

                ·where we need to retain the information to comply with federal, state, or local laws or for
                accounting or tax purposes;

                ·where we need to comply with a civil, criminal, or regulatory inquiry, investigation, subpoena, or
                summons by federal, state, or local authorities;

                ·where we need to cooperate with law enforcement agencies concerning conduct or activity that the
                business, service provider, or third party reasonably and in good faith believes may violate
                federal, state, or local law;

                ·where we need to retain information to exercise or defend legal claims;

                ·where the information contains legal privilege or proprietary information of another party; or

                ·where complying with the request would compromise others’ privacy or other legitimate rights.

                If we determine that we cannot respond to any request in any particular instance, we will provide
                you with an explanation of why that determination has been made and a contact point for any further
                inquiries. To protect your privacy, we will take commercially reasonable steps to verify your
                identity before responding to any request under this provision, including complying with any
                applicable legal requirement for verifying your identity.<br>


                Transfer of Information<br>
                Please note, we may store your Personal Information on servers located in the countries where our
                main offices are located. If such jurisdiction is outside your jurisdiction of residence, you
                consent to the transfer of your Personal Information to such jurisdiction for purposes of providing
                the Platform to you, even if such other jurisdiction has less protections for Personal Information
                than your jurisdiction of residence. We will ensure that security provisions are in place consistent
                with our obligations to maintain the security of your Personal Information under the laws of your
                jurisdiction of residence.<br>


                Retention<br>
                We retain your Personal Information as long as you maintain an Account on the Platform. We will
                cease to retain your Personal Information, or remove the means by which the Personal Information can
                be associated with particular individuals, as soon as it is reasonable to assume that —
                (a) the purpose for which that Personal Information was collected is no longer being served by its
                retention; and
                (b) retention is no longer necessary for legal, accounting or business purposes.
                Please note that certain laws may require us to retain records of transactions or accounts for a
                certain period of time.

                Blockchain Information<br>
                You should be aware that due to the inherent transparency of the blockchain networks, transactions
                that you approve when using the Platform may be publicly accessible. This includes, but is not
                limited to, your public key address, the public key address of the receiver, the amount of crypto
                sent or received, and any other data a User has chosen to include in a given transaction.

                Transactions and addresses available on blockchain networks may reveal Personal Information about
                the User’s identity, and Personal Information can potentially be correlated now or in the future by
                any party who chooses to do so, including law enforcement. We encourage you to review how privacy
                and transparency on blockchain networks works.<br>

                Children Under 18<br>
                Our Platform is not designed for children under 18. If we discover that a child under 18 has
                provided us with Personal Information, we will delete such information from our systems.<br>

                Contact Us<br>
                If you have questions about the privacy aspects of our Platform or would like to make a complaint,
                please contact us via our live chat services or at helpdesk@annexwave.com.<br>

                Changes to this Policy<br>
                This Policy is current as of the Effective Date set forth above. We may change this Policy from time
                to time, so please be sure to check back periodically. We will post any changes to this Policy on
                the Platform. If we make any changes to this Policy that materially affect our practices with regard
                to the Personal Information we have previously collected from you, we will endeavor to provide you
                with notice in advance of such change by highlighting the change on our Platform or providing a push
                notification through the Site (you should make sure your Site settings allow for such push
                notifications) or sending an email that you have provided in your Account, (for this reason you
                should make sure to update your account information promptly if it changes).</p>
